== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I install this plugin? =

Many Worpdress sites are bombarded by automated scripts trying to log in to the admin over and over. 

The No Captcha is a very simple, ManLogin-supported test to quickly deny access to automated scripts. It is great by itself to instantly make your Wordpress site more secure, or can be used with other plugins (like ManLogin Authenticator, Limit Login Attempts, etc.) as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.

= There are a lot of other plugins for this, why should I install <em>this</em> one? =

I've gone to great lengths to try to make sure this plugin is easy to use and install. So far, it just works.

= Does this plugin add a PCAPTCHA to comment forms? =

No. This plugin is designed to thwart automated hacking attempts, not prevent comment spam. Most good comment plugins have their own spam prevention methods. This plugin tries to do just a few things well.

= Does this plugin add a CAPTCHA to custom forms? =

No. This plugin is designed to thwart automated hacking attempts, not prevent spam from custom forms. Most good custom form plugins have their own spam prevention methods. Many of them support a CAPTCHA field already. This plugin tries to do just a few things well.
